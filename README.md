"Next steps for the Rust type system"

# Abstract:

Rust reached 1.0 in 2015 and in that time has gone from a brave experiment to a production language in use at most every major company. Rust marks the first substructural type system to achieve widespread adoption in industry. This talk covers some of our experiences in developing and using Rust as well as some ideas about where we are going over the next few years.
